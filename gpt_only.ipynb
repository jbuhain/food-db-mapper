    "    # PROMPT = \"Given the following list of food names, could you give me a list of food names that correspond best to the target FoodName provided? Make sure that the foods you select is from the list of food names given. When matching food names to the target, prioritize matching the food type rather than focusing on additional descriptors like quality or preparation method. For example, given the list ['parsley fresh', 'parsley dried', 'celery raw'] and the target 'parsley, raw', look for food names that include the exact term 'parsley,' such as 'parsley fresh' and 'parsley dried,' and ignore the 'raw' part if it is not relevant to the exact food name. When matching food names to the target, break down the target into core food types and look for any items in the list that contain these core types. For the target 'currant, black, raw,' identify the main food types, which are 'currant' and 'blackcurrant.' In the list ['currants dried', 'redcurrant', 'blackcurrants'], both 'currants dried' and 'blackcurrants' should be considered matches since they include the core type 'currant' or 'blackcurrant.' Focus on the key food types rather than the specific descriptors like 'raw' or 'dried. You do not have to choose any from the filtered similar food if you believe that none of the filtered foods matches the food name best. If none of the provided food items correspond best to the target food item, then just return None. When matching food names to the target, concentrate on identifying the primary food type and any relevant attributes, even if they are not exactly the same. For the target 'milk, partly skimmed, konventional (not organic), 1.5 % fat,' the core food type is 'milk' and the key attribute is 'partly skimmed.' When matching food names to the target, emphasize the key descriptors and core attributes of the food item. For the target 'sugar, sucrose, white,' the essential components are 'sugar' and 'white.' In the list ['sugar soft white', 'sugar white', 'syrup sugar'], 'sugar white' and 'sugar soft white' should both be considered matches because they include the core attribute 'sugar' and the key descriptor 'white.' The presence of additional terms or variations in the descriptor should not prevent a match if the core attributes are present. In the list ['milk partly skimmed 0,6% fat', 'milk semi-skimmed', 'milk skimmed'], 'milk partly skimmed 0,6% fat' should be recognized as a match because it contains both the food type 'milk' and the attribute 'partly skimmed,' even though the fat percentage is different. Focus on the essential characteristics that match the target’s description. When matching food names to the target, prioritize the main food type. For the target 'lard, pork,' the essential food type is 'lard.' In the list ['lard', 'beef fat', 'pork >19% fat prepared'], 'lard' should be recognized as a match because it matches the primary food type of the target, even if 'pork' is not explicitly mentioned. Focus on identifying the key food type from the target and finding any items in the list that include that type. When matching food names to the target, focus on recognizing variations or short forms of the food type.  If the target refers to a well-known food item, look for any list items that contain key elements or recognizable variations of that food type. For example, if the target is 'nut, coco,' which refers to 'coconut,' match it with any list items that include 'coconut,' regardless of additional words or the arrangement of terms.  Provide your answer in list format for example ['foodA','foodB'....].\"\n",
